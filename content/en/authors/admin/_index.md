## Purpose <i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly, **Reproducible Teaching (RT)** ia a methodology for active learning with coding. Hence, it combines programming codes with thematic content. In practice, *RT* is simply applying codes written in plain text to have a program generate a product of interest to Education, such as a graph, a table, a media, a text formatted for PDF or DOCX, a simulation, an animation, among many others.

In this way, it is possible to imagine that a student can repeat the execution of the code in a specific program, modify some part of the code to observe a different result, or even create a new code seeking another final product.

RT should be practiced with Open Educational Resources, with free programs and, preferably, with access by simple internet browser, to allow its use by the largest number of users, without restrictions on machine configuration, and allowing access both by desktop and notebooks as by mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.
